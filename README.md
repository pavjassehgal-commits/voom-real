# Voom

Voom is a marketing platform for small businesses. MARA, its AI marketing
manager, plans, drafts, and reports on campaigns on the business's behalf.

This repository is currently in its first phase: a bare Next.js scaffold with
the approved Voom visual identity (ink/dark background, signal-orange accent,
deep-teal support colour) and three placeholder routes. No backend services
are connected yet.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run lint    # ESLint
npm run build   # production build
npm run start   # serve the production build
```

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in values as integrations are
added. `.env.example` only contains placeholder variable names — never commit
real secrets. `.env`, `.env.local`, and other secret env files are gitignored.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
